    # Introduction

    Belvo is an open banking API for Latin America that allows companies to access banking and fiscal information in a secure as well as agile way.

    Through our API, you can access:


    - **Bank information** such as account information, real-time
    balance, historical transactions, and account owner identification.

    - **Fiscal information** such as received and sent invoices and tax returns.

    alt="fiscal-endpoints">


    In this API reference you'll find all the information you need about each

    endpoint and resource.

    ## Environment

    We currently offer three environments: sandbox, development, and
    production.


    When using our SDKs, make sure to use the **Alias** (and not the Base URL).


    | Environment | Purpose | Access |
    |-----------|-------|-------|
    | **Sandbox** | The [Sandbox environment](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/test-in-sandbox) is dedicated for your testing and development phases. In this environment, you can create links without real credentials and you can pull test data from all endpoints. **⚠️The sandbox environment is refreshed frequently and your test data can be updated or deleted.** | Base URL (cURL): https://sandbox.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): sandbox|
    |**Development**|The Development environment is dedicated for testing with real credentials and institutions with real-world institutions. You can create up to 25 links for free in this environment.| Base URL (cURL): https://development.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): development |
    | **Production** | The Production environment is dedicated for live applications with real connections to institutions. In this environment, you
    will need real credentials to create links and you will pull real data from the institutions.| Base URL (cURL): https://api.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias
    (SDKs): production|


    For each environment, you'll need to [generate separate API
    keys](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/get-your-belvo-api-keys).


    ## Response codes


    We use the following HTTP status code in the response depending on the
    success or failure:


    | Status Code | Description |
    |-----------|-------|
    | `200` | ✅ **Success** - The content is available in the response body. |
    | `201` | ✅ **Success** - The content was created successfully on Belvo. |
    | `204` | ✅ **Success** - No content to return. |
    | `400` | ❌ **Bad Request Error** - Request returned an error, detail in content.|
    | `401` | ❌ **Unauthorized** - The Belvo credentials provided are not valid.|
    | `404` | ❌ **Not Found** - The resource you try to access cannot be found.|
    | `405` | ❌ **Method Not Allowed** - The HTTP method you are using is not accepted for this resource.|
    | `408` | ❌ **Request Timeout** - The request timed out and was terminated by the server.|
    | `428` | ❌ **MFA Token Required** - MFA token was required by the institution to connect. |
    | `500` | ❌ **Internal Server Error** - The detail of the error is available in the response body.|


    ## Error handling


    ### Error messages


    Belvo API errors are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might
    look like this:


    ```json

    [
        {
          "request_id": "a6e1c493d7a29d91aed4338e6fcf077d",
          "message": "This field is required.",
          "code": "required",
          "field": "link"
        }
    ]

    ```


    Typically, an error response will have the following parameters:

    - `request_id`: a unique ID for the request, you should share it with the
    Belvo support team for investigations.

    - `message`: human-readable description of the error.

    - `code`: a unique code for the error. Check the table below to see how to
    handle each error code.

    - `field` *(optional)*: The specific field in the request body that has an
    issue.



    ### Request identifier

    When you need help with a specific error, add the request identifier
    (`request_id`) in your message to the Belvo support team. This will speed up
    investigations and get you back up and running in no time at all.


    ### Error codes and troubleshooting


    For a full list of errors and how to troubleshoot them, please see our
    dedicated [Error handling
    articles](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/integration-overview#error-handling)
    in our DevPortal.



    ### Retry policy


    Please see our recommended [retry
    policies](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/integration-overview#error-retry-policy)
    in the DevPortal.

    A **Link** is a set of credentials associated to an end-user's access to an **institution**.

    <div style="background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid #808080;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right: 25px">
    <strong>Example: </strong> The username and password combination used to log in to an online banking application would be a link.
    </div>

    You will need to register a **Link** before accessing information from that specific end-user, such as account or transaction details.

    <div style="background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid #4CAF50;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right: 25px">
    <strong>Note: </strong> We recommend using our <a href="https://developers.belvo.com/docs/connect-widget" target="_blank">Connect Widget</a> to handle link creation and link status updates.
    </div>

    You have the possibility to register two types of links:

    ### Recurrent links (default)

    With recurrent links, Belvo automatically refreshes information weekly and notifies you via [Webhooks](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/webhooks) so you always have up-to-date data. Then, when you receive the webhook, you can make GET requests to the List or Detail endpoints to instantly access up-to-date information, without needing to connect to the institution.

    <img src="https://files.readme.io/7b6c0d4-Recurrent_Link_FLow.png" alt="fiscal-endpoints" width="950">

    You can also make POST calls directly to the institution, as with single links, as soon as the link is created. However, we recommend you follow the flow described above (waiting for the webhook event) for a more optimal experience.

    ### Single links

    Single links are used to perform ad hoc data access to accounts, owners, transactions, and so on. For example, you can use it when you want to do an underwriting process to assess risk before lending money.

    For single links, you have to perform POST calls to an institution **every time** you want to access fresh data.

        If you try to access older information than what we can access, we will return all the data we can read within that date range. For example, if you request transactions for the last year and we can only access the last six months, we will return the information corresponding to these six months of data. </div>

            Recommended header parameter to make your POST request to retrieve transactions asynchronous (thus preventing timeouts).

            When you make a asynchronous request, Belvo responds with a `202 - Accepted` payload, including the `request_id`. Once we have retrieved the transaction information, you will receive a `new_transactions_available` webhook with the link and request IDs.


            **Note**: This parameter is case sensitive (in other words, if you write `ASYNC`, then Belvo will default to a synchronous call).

        Complete a new payment intent.

        During the payment intent flow, you'll need to prompt your customer to provide additional information about their institution, bank account, and login credentials. This is done by sending PATCH calls with the information that Belvo asked you display in each `next_step` object. If you need more information on how to complete a payment intent, check our PSE payment initiation guides for  🇨🇴 Colombia.

            Type of document to be used as a username.

            Some banking institutions accept different documents to be used as the `username` to login. For example, the *Cédula de Ciudadanía*, *Cédula de Extranjería*, *Pasaporte'*, and so on.

            For banks that require a document to log in, you **must** provide the `username_type` parameter to specify which document is used when creating the link.

            ℹ️ To know which institutions require the `username_type` parameter, get the [details](https://developers.belvo.com/reference/detailinstitution) for the institution and check the `form_fields` array in the response.

            For certain fiscal institutions, it is possible to log in using a certificate and a private key, which enables a faster connection to the institution.

            Belvo supports a base64 encoded `private_key`. If the `private_key` parameter is used, you *must* also provide the `certificate` parameter.
